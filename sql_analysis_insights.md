# SQL Analysis and Insights

## 1️⃣ Which products and sub-categories are least profitable or losing money?  

#### 💡 Logic explained: 
* We calculated Profit margin `(SUM(profit)/SUM(sales))` measures the efficiency of each sale, indicating how much profit is generated relative to revenue.
* Filtered out low-sales products (e.g., `HAVING SUM(sales) > 100`) removes noise from one-off or insignificant losses.
* Ordered by total profit ascending first, then by profit margin highlights the products and subcategories causing the largest financial loss while still considering their profitability efficiency.

#### 🔍 Insights
1. Technology Products Are Major Loss Drivers
    * The printers alone account for total loss ≈ ₹16,700 across just 3–4 orders per product.
    * Profit margins extremely negative (-48% to -80%), indicating massive discounting or high costs.
2. Furniture – Tables Lose Consistently
    * Tables (Chromcraft, BoxOffice, Bush Advantage) → margin -20% to -67%
    * Total units sold are moderate, but repeated losses - category-wide issue
3. Volume ≠ Profit
    * Some products (e.g., Machines) have low units sold but huge losses, high-cost items can disproportionately hurt profit.

## 2️⃣ How does discount affect profit?
#### 💡 Logic explained: 
* Grouped discounts into ranges that support pricing decisions.
* Added volume (SUM(quantity)) so high-discount, high-volume effects are visible.
* Filtered low-impact data (HAVING SUM(sales) > 500) to remove noise.
* Ordered by total profit first, then margin, so the most damaging discount levels surface immediately.

### ➡️ Discount ranges on profit  
<img width="765" height="205" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7264e921-b4d4-4384-9009-fc7538044fb4" />

#### 🔍 Insights  
1. Deep discounts are the primary driver of losses.    
    * Orders with 30%+ discounts generate ₹259K in sales but result in ₹125K in losses, with a –48% profit margin. - Loss magnitude is 12× larger than the 20–30% bucket

2. Discount effectiveness has a clear breaking point.  
    * Discounts up to 20% remain profitable (12–17% margin), but profitability turns negative beyond 20%. The 20–30% discount band already loses money (–10% margin), signaling a clear discount threshold.

3. Revenue growth from heavy discounting is misleading.  
    * Although 888 orders and 4,526 units were sold at 30%+ discounts, these sales erase nearly 40% of the profit generated by full-price orders.
    * High sales volume under deep discounts does not translate into business growth.

* Orders without discounts deliver a 30% profit margin and generate ₹321K profit, making them the most reliable and sustainable revenue source.
---
### ✅ Recommendations 

1. Cap discounts at 20% to stop profit leakage
    * Eliminating 30%+ discounts could immediately recover ₹125K in losses. 
    * Reducing 20–30% discounts could save an additional ₹10K+  

📌 The true discount threshold is 20% .
📌 Total potential profit recovery: ₹135K+

2.  Redefine success metrics for promotions 
      * Move away from tracking orders and revenue alone.
      * Introduce KPIs such as:
        * Profit per discounted order
        * Profit margin by discount band
This prevents future campaigns from prioritizing volume at the expense of profitability.

3. Restrict 30%+ discounts to clearance only
    Impact: Prevents 48% margin loss per sale

4. Reallocate promotions to the 10–20% range
   Impact:
       * Maintains strong volume (2,436 orders)
       * Preserves positive $91.8K profit

## 3️⃣ Which products are losing the most profit due to high discounts, and how much revenue is affected?

#### 💡 Logic explained: 
* Filtered orders with `WHERE discount >= 0.2` → isolates high-discount transactions that are likely to erode profit
* Add `HAVING SUM(sales) > 100` or similar to filter noise.
* Ordered by total_profit ascending → surfaces products causing the largest absolute losses.
  
 ### ➡️ Products least profitable, due to high discounts
<img width="1286" height="366" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73b5633e-fb93-4710-bc8a-f9678433b909" />

#### 🔍 Insights  
1. High discounts are destroying profitability across multiple categories. All top 10 loss-making products have average discounts ≥ 34%, with several >50%.
2. Technology (Machines) products are extreme loss drivers. 
    * Example - Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Double Head Print → 3 orders, 9 units, $8,879 loss, –80% margin, 53% discount.
    * High-ticket technology products are over-discounted, directly destroying profit.

3. High-ticket, low-volume products are dangerous.
   * Single orders (e.g., 3D printers, Cisco EX90) can create massive absolute losses.

4. Office Supplies Binders are consistently unprofitable at high discounts
    * Examples: GBC DocuBind P400, Ibimaster 500 → profit margins –35% to –46%, avg discounts 54–58%.
    * High volume (23–35 units) doesn’t compensate for extreme discounting.

---
### ✅ Recommendations 
1. Cap discounts for Technology (Machines) at ≤20%
    * Prevents catastrophic losses like –80% margin, $8–9K per product loss.
    * Only allow higher discounts for clearance or strategic loss-leading with explicit approval.

2. Reassess Office Supplies Binders promotions
    * Current avg discount 54–58% → unsustainable.
    * Reduce standard discount to ≤20–25% or replace with bundle deals that preserve margin.

3. Limit Furniture discounts
   * Keep below 30% for high-ticket items like Tables & Bookcases.
   * Monitor margins; adjust promo strategy to avoid –40% losses.

4. Track high-ticket low-volume items separately
    * Products like Cisco TelePresence EX90 and Cubify 3D Printers → small volume but massive loss.
    * Requires manual approval for any discounts above safe threshold.

##  4️⃣ Which customer segments are least profitable?

#### 💡 Logic explained:
* Group orders by `segment`
* Filters tiny segments `HAVING SUM(sales) > 500` → reduces noise
  
### ➡️ Least profitable customer segments
<img width="776" height="145" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37e761c7-3cef-4906-bd99-bd8b0c6a0517" />

#### 🔍 Insights 
1. Consumer segment generates the largest absolute profit (12% margin, profit $134K), but has the lowest efficiency per dollar of sales.
2. High-volume segments may drive revenue, but low margins indicate costs or discounts erode efficiency.
    * Consumer segment has 2,586 orders (highest volume) → drives largest total profit, but only 12% margin.
    * Home Office has lower volume (909 orders) → smaller total profit ($60K) but highest margin (14%).
---  
### ✅ Recommendations 
1. Optimize Consumer segment margins
    * Current margin 12% is lowest despite highest revenue.
    * Actions:
        * Reduce over-discounting or promotions targeting Consumer segment.
        * Negotiate better costs for products popular with this segment.
    * Impact: Could raise margin by 2–3%, adding ~$23–35K incremental profit.

2. Leverage Home Office for efficiency
    * Highest margin (14%) → focus marketing and cross-sell to increase volume.
    * Impact: Maintaining efficiency while scaling volume boosts overall profit without margin erosion.
3. Segment-level discount monitoring
   * Check if Consumer segment is over-discounted, contributing to low margin.
   * Apply discount caps or selective promotions based on segment profitability.

## 5️⃣ Which regions are underperforming?  

#### 💡 Logic explained:
* Grouped orders by `region`.
* Added `HAVING SUM(sales) > 500` to filter noise from tiny regions
  
### ➡️ Underperforming regions
<img width="776" height="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96b99482-7571-405c-b601-564086759264" />

#### 🔍 Insights 
1. Central region is underperforming
    * Profit margin: 8%, lowest among all regions
    * Total profit: $39.7K on $501K sales → efficiency is poor compared to others
    * Despite 1,175 orders, Central delivers lowest margin, signaling either high discounts, high costs, or low-value products driving revenue.

2. East and West regions are strong performers
    * West: 15% margin, $108K profit
    * East: 13% margin, $91.5K profit
    * Both regions generate high absolute profit and efficiency, likely due to higher-value products, better cost control, or optimal discounting.
3. Low margin is not just about volume
    * Central has more orders than South (1,175 vs 822) but significantly lower profit margin (8% vs 12%)
    * Simply increasing sales volume does not guarantee profitability; costs and discounts are key drivers.
 ---     
### ✅ Recommendations 
1. Segmented strategies
    * For Central: consider targeted marketing, bundle deals, or upselling higher-margin products.
    * For South: maintain current approach but explore growth opportunities without sacrificing margin.

2. Investigate Central region’s cost and pricing structure
    * Analyze product mix, discounts, and operational costs.
    * Increase margin from 8% → closer to South/East (12–13%).
    * Even a 4–5% improvement in margin has a $20K–$25K impact on profit without increasing sales volume.

3. Leverage best practices from West and East.
    * West achieves 15% margin → replicate pricing, product mix, or sales strategies in Central.

## 6️⃣ Which months have the lowest profit, indicating periods that need attention?

#### 💡 Logic explained: 
* Uses a `CAS`E on `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)` to assign each order to a quarter
* Filters out negligible quarters: `HAVING SUM(sales) > 500`
 
### ➡️ Quarter with least profit
<img width="672" height="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c3a990-f74b-4fc6-88ff-19c8745b26a4" />

#### 🔍 Insights  
1.  Q2 and Q3 have the lowest margins (12%).
    * Despite increasing sales volume (Q2: $445K, Q3: $614K), margins are lower than Q1 and Q4 (13%).  
    * Revenue growth in these quarters comes at the expense of efficiency, possibly due to higher discounts, promotions, or higher costs.

2. Q1 and Q4 are the most efficient quarters (13% margin)
    * Q4 is the strongest in absolute profit: $110K with highest sales ($878K).
    * Q1 has lower volume but maintains margin efficiency.

3. Profit grows with sales, but efficiency fluctuates. Q2 and Q3 have larger volumes than Q1, but margins are slightly lower → indicates cost or discount pressures in mid-year periods.

3. Seasonal pattern hints
    * Q4 performs best, likely driven by year-end demand or holiday promotions.
    * Mid-year (Q2/Q3) may require attention to pricing and cost control. 
---
### ✅ Recommendations 
1. Investigate Q2 and Q3 performance
    * Identify products, regions, or customer segments driving lower margins.
    * Assess if heavy promotions, high discounts, or operational costs are impacting efficiency.

2. Optimize mid-year pricing or promotions
    * Cap discounts or focus on higher-margin SKUs in Q2/Q3 to improve profitability.
    * Consider targeted marketing to increase profitable volume rather than just total sales.

3. Leverage Q4 practices
    * Replicate Q4 pricing, promotion, or product mix strategies in mid-year quarters where feasible.

4. Forecasting and resource allocation.Use seasonal trends to plan inventory, staffing, and marketing spend efficiently.Use seasonal trends to plan inventory, staffing, and marketing spend efficiently.
